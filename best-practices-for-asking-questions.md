## 1️⃣ Be Clear and Concise

- 🎯 **State Your Objective:** Begin with a clear statement of what you're trying to achieve or the problem you're facing.
- 📝 **Assignment Context:** Mention what assignment and exercise you're working on.
- 🔗 **Provide a Link:** Include a link to the assignment if available.

## 2️⃣ Provide Necessary Details

- 🚫 **Error Messages:** Include any error messages or output that you're encountering, verbatim.
- 💻 **Relevant Code:** Share only the relevant portion of your code that is causing the issue. Use proper formatting.
- 🧾 **Command Used:** Share the command you used, where you ran it, and what it returned.
- 🧪 **What You've Tried:** Mention what solutions or debugging steps you've already attempted.
- 📂 **GitHub Repository:** Provide a link to your GitHub repo so others can explore the full code context if needed.

## 3️⃣ Format Your Question Properly

- 📄 **Code Blocks:** Use Slack's code block (triple backticks ```) for sharing code or error messages to improve readability.
- 🖼️ **Screenshots:** Include screenshots when necessary, but prefer text for logs and code snippets so they can be copied and searched.

## 4️⃣ Tag People and Use Channels Wisely

- 📢 **Relevant Channels:** Post your question in the most appropriate channel.
- 📬 **Direct Messages:** Use DMs for specific queries, but respect the recipient's time and availability.

## 5️⃣ Follow Up and Give Feedback

- ♻️ **Update the Thread:** If you solve the issue, post your solution or a summary.
- 🙌 **Appreciation:** Acknowledge the help you receive. It encourages community support.

## 6️⃣ Respect Everyone's Time

- 📚 **Initial Research:** Try solving the problem yourself using documentation or search engines.
- ⏳ **Be Patient:** Helpers have their own tasks and responsibilities.
- 🧪 **Reproducibility:** Give exact steps to reproduce the issue, including necessary commands like:

  ```sh
  git clone https://url-to-repository && cd path/to/assignment && compile-command && run-command
  ```
